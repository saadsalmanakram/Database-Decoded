# üì± **SQLite**: The Light, Serverless, Self-Contained Database Engine

---

## **What is SQLite?**

**SQLite** is a **serverless, self-contained, file-based relational database engine**. Unlike traditional database systems that rely on a server to store and manage data, SQLite stores all its data in a single file, making it a lightweight and portable solution ideal for applications that require local data storage.

SQLite is widely used in applications, embedded systems, mobile apps, and web browsers due to its simplicity, reliability, and minimal setup requirements.

## üß© **Core Features**

1. **Serverless**  
   - No need for a separate database server. The database is directly embedded into the application.

2. **Zero Configuration**  
   - SQLite requires no setup, installation, or administration, making it an excellent choice for developers looking for an easy-to-use database.

3. **Lightweight**  
   - SQLite has a small footprint, making it ideal for applications where minimal resource usage is critical.

4. **Cross-Platform**  
   - SQLite is fully cross-platform, working on various operating systems like **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **Android**, and **iOS**.

5. **ACID-Compliant**  
   - Ensures **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability** for safe transaction handling, even with limited resources.

6. **Fully Relational**  
   - Supports full SQL functionality, including **joins**, **subqueries**, **triggers**, and **views**.

7. **Fast and Efficient**  
   - Despite its lightweight nature, SQLite is fast and highly efficient, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second.

## üöÄ **Key Use Cases**

1. **Embedded Systems**  
   - SQLite is commonly used in devices with limited resources, such as embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and digital cameras.

2. **Mobile Applications**  
   - SQLite is the preferred database for storing local data on **iOS** and **Android** apps, providing offline data storage and synchronization.

3. **Web Browsers**  
   - Many modern web browsers (like Firefox, Chrome) use SQLite to store local data such as bookmarks, browsing history, and cache.

4. **Desktop Applications**  
   - SQLite is used in desktop applications for lightweight local data storage, including applications like **KeePass** and **Skype**.

5. **Testing and Prototyping**  
   - Due to its simplicity and minimal configuration, SQLite is ideal for quickly testing database-backed applications during development and prototyping.

## üîß **Key Features & Capabilities**

1. **Single File Database**  
   - The entire database is stored in a single file, making it highly portable and easy to share or move between different environments.

2. **Full SQL Support**  
   - Supports a wide range of SQL syntax, including **select** statements, **joins**, **aggregates**, **transactions**, and more.

3. **Transaction Support**  
   - SQLite supports **atomic transactions** even if the application crashes, ensuring data integrity.

4. **Full-Text Search (FTS)**  
   - SQLite offers built-in full-text search capabilities for managing and searching large text-based datasets.

5. **Concurrency**  
   - Although SQLite supports multiple readers at the same time, it locks the database when writing, making it less suitable for high-concurrency applications.

6. **Data Integrity**  
   - Features like **foreign key constraints** and **checks** help maintain data integrity and consistency.

### **Linux (Ubuntu)**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

### **macOS (Using Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install sqlite
```

### **Windows**
