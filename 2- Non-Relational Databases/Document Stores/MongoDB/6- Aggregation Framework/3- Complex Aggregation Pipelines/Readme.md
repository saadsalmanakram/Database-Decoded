### **Complex Aggregation Pipelines in MongoDB**

MongoDB's **aggregation framework** allows for the creation of complex data processing pipelines. A **complex aggregation pipeline** typically combines multiple stages, operators, and expressions to perform intricate operations on data. These pipelines can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as filtering, grouping, joining, and transforming data in various ways.

Hereâ€™s a deeper dive into **complex aggregation pipelines**, how to construct them, and some advanced use cases.

### **1. Multi-stage Pipelines**

A **multi-stage aggregation pipeline** involves using several stages that perform different operations, such as filtering, transforming, grouping, and sorting. Each stage is applied sequentially, with the output of one stage becoming the input for the next.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$totalAmount" } } },
  { $sort: { totalSpent: -1 } },
  { $limit: 5 }
])
```

**Explanation:**
- **`$match`**: Filters orders that are marked as "delivered".
- **`$group`**: Groups the orders by `customerId` and sums up the `totalAmount`.
- **`$sort`**: Sorts the results by the total amount spent in descending order.
- **`$limit`**: Limits the result to the top 5 customers.

### **2. Using `$lookup` with Multiple Pipelines (Nested Aggregation)**

MongoDB allows you to perform a **join** operation within the aggregation pipeline using the `$lookup` operator. In complex pipelines, you can use **nested aggregation** within the `$lookup` stage to filter, sort, or project the documents of the joined collection.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } },
  { 
    $lookup: {
      from: "products",
      let: { orderItems: "$items" },
      pipeline: [
        { $unwind: "$orderItems" },
        { $match: { $expr: { $in: ["$orderItems.productId", "$$orderItems.productId"] } } },
        { $project: { _id: 0, name: 1, price: 1 } }
      ],
      as: "productDetails"
    }
  },
  { $unwind: "$productDetails" },
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$productDetails.price" } } },
  { $sort: { totalSpent: -1 } }
])
```

**Explanation:**
- **`$lookup`**: Joins the `orders` collection with the `products` collection using the `items` field in `orders` and the `productId` field in `products`.
  - Inside the `$lookup`, a sub-pipeline is defined to unwind the `orderItems` array, filter matching `productId` values, and project the product's name and price.
- **`$unwind`**: Deconstructs the `productDetails` array from the `$lookup` results.
- **`$group`**: Aggregates total spending for each customer by summing up the prices of their purchased products.

### **3. Using `$facet` for Multi-dimensional Aggregation**

The `$facet` operator allows you to run multiple sub-pipelines in parallel within a single pipeline. This is useful when you need to compute multiple aggregations simultaneously, such as fetching summaries and detailed information at the same time.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } },
  { 
    $facet: {
      "totalSpentByCustomers": [
        { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$totalAmount" } } },
        { $sort: { totalSpent: -1 } },
        { $limit: 5 }
      ],
      "totalOrders": [
        { $group: { _id: null, totalCount: { $sum: 1 } } }
      ]
    }
  }
])
```

**Explanation:**
- **`$facet`**: Creates two parallel pipelines:
  - **`totalSpentByCustomers`**: Groups by `customerId` and sums up their spending, then sorts and limits the result.
  - **`totalOrders`**: Groups all documents (with `_id: null`) and counts the total number of orders.
  
This allows the aggregation to return two distinct results (the top 5 customers by spending and the total number of orders) in a single operation.

### **4. Using `$addFields` and `$set` for Additional Fields**

The `$addFields` operator adds new fields to documents. This can be used to calculate new values based on existing fields or to enhance documents with additional metadata during the pipeline.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } },
  { $addFields: { 
      deliveryDate: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m-%d", date: "$deliveryDate" } },
      discount: { $cond: { if: { $gt: ["$totalAmount", 100] }, then: 10, else: 0 } }
    }
  },
  { $project: { customerName: 1, totalAmount: 1, deliveryDate: 1, discount: 1 } }
])
```

**Explanation:**
- **`$addFields`**: Adds a new field `deliveryDate` by formatting the existing `deliveryDate` field to a string, and adds a `discount` field, where customers with orders greater than 100 receive a 10% discount.
- **`$project`**: Projects the `customerName`, `totalAmount`, `deliveryDate`, and `discount` fields.

---

### **5. Combining `$group` and `$project` for Complex Aggregation**

You can combine the `$group` and `$project` operators to perform more sophisticated aggregations where you group data and simultaneously manipulate the result set using additional projections.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } },
  { $group: {
      _id: "$customerId",
      totalSpent: { $sum: "$totalAmount" },
      avgSpent: { $avg: "$totalAmount" },
      orderCount: { $count: {} }
    }
  },
  { $project: {
      totalSpent: 1,
      avgSpent: { $round: ["$avgSpent", 2] },
      orderCount: 1,
      highSpender: { $gt: ["$totalSpent", 500] }
    }
  }
])
```

**Explanation:**
- **`$group`**: Groups by `customerId` and calculates the total amount spent, the average amount spent, and the count of orders for each customer.
- **`$project`**: Projects the `totalSpent`, the rounded `avgSpent`, `orderCount`, and a boolean field `highSpender` that checks if the customer spent more than 500.

### **6. Conditional Aggregation with `$cond`**

The `$cond` operator allows you to perform conditional logic within the aggregation pipeline, similar to an `if-else` statement in programming.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } },
  { $group: {
      _id: "$customerId",
      totalSpent: { $sum: "$totalAmount" },
      rewardPoints: { 
        $sum: { $cond: { if: { $gt: ["$totalAmount", 100] }, then: 10, else: 5 } } 
      }
    }
  }
])
```

**Explanation:**
- **`$cond`**: Adds reward points based on the `totalAmount` of each order. If the order amount is greater than 100, the customer earns 10 points; otherwise, they earn 5 points.
