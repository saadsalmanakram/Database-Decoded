### **Basic Aggregation Pipeline Operators in MongoDB**

MongoDB's aggregation framework allows you to use a series of operators within the aggregation pipeline to process and transform data. These operators perform various actions such as filtering, reshaping, grouping, sorting, and joining data from different collections. Below is an overview of the most commonly used **aggregation pipeline operators** in MongoDB:

---

### **1. `$match`**

The `$match` operator is used to filter documents based on specified conditions, similar to the `find()` query method. It is often the first stage in an aggregation pipeline. This operator allows you to filter documents according to specific criteria before applying further operations.

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
{ $match: { <field>: <value> } }
```

#### **Example:**
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } }
])
```
This will only return documents where the `status` field is equal to `"delivered"`.

---

### **2. `$project`**

The `$project` operator reshapes documents by including or excluding specific fields, creating new fields, or modifying the values of existing fields. It's used to control which fields appear in the output.

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
{ $project: { <field1>: <value1>, <field2>: <value2>, ... } }
```
Where `<value1>` and `<value2>` can be `1` (include), `0` (exclude), or an expression.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $project: { _id: 0, customerName: 1, totalAmount: 1 } }
])
```
This will return only the `customerName` and `totalAmount` fields for each order, excluding the `_id` field.

---

### **3. `$group`**

The `$group` operator is used to group documents by a specified expression and perform aggregate operations like counting, summing, averaging, etc., on grouped data.

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
{ $group: { _id: <expression>, <field1>: { <operation1>: <expression> }, <field2>: { <operation2>: <expression> }, ... } }
```

#### **Example:**
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$totalAmount" } } }
])
```
This will group the orders by `customerId` and calculate the total amount spent (`totalAmount`) for each customer.

---

### **4. `$sort`**

The `$sort` operator sorts the documents based on specified fields. You can sort in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order.

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
{ $sort: { <field1>: <order1>, <field2>: <order2>, ... } }
```

#### **Example:**
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $sort: { totalAmount: -1 } }
])
```
This will sort the orders by `totalAmount` in descending order (from highest to lowest).

---

### **5. `$limit`**

The `$limit` operator restricts the number of documents passed to the next stage in the pipeline. It is useful for limiting the number of results returned.

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
{ $limit: <number> }
```

#### **Example:**
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $limit: 5 }
])
```
This will return only the first 5 documents from the result set.

---

### **6. `$skip`**

The `$skip` operator skips the first N documents in the pipeline. It is commonly used in pagination scenarios to retrieve the next set of results.

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
{ $skip: <number> }
```

#### **Example:**
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $skip: 10 }
])
```
This will skip the first 10 documents in the result set.

---

### **7. `$unwind`**

The `$unwind` operator deconstructs an array field from the input documents and outputs a document for each element in the array. This is useful when you need to flatten an array field.

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
{ $unwind: <arrayField> }
```

#### **Example:**
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$items" }
])
```
This will deconstruct the `items` array in each order and return a separate document for each item.

---

### **8. `$lookup`**

The `$lookup` operator is used for **joining** documents from one collection into another, essentially performing a left outer join. It enables you to combine data from two collections based on a common field.

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
{ 
  $lookup: { 
    from: <collection>, 
    localField: <field1>, 
    foreignField: <field2>, 
    as: <outputArray> 
  } 
}
```

- `from`: The collection to join with.
- `localField`: The field from the input documents (the first collection).
- `foreignField`: The field from the documents of the `from` collection (the second collection).
- `as`: The name of the new array field that will contain the joined documents.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $lookup: { from: "products", localField: "productId", foreignField: "_id", as: "productDetails" } }
])
```
This will join the `orders` collection with the `products` collection using the `productId` field from the `orders` collection and the `_id` field from the `products` collection. The result will include an array field `productDetails` containing the product information.

---

### **Summary**

- **`$match`**: Filters documents based on conditions (similar to `find()`).
- **`$project`**: Reshapes documents, including/excluding fields.
- **`$group`**: Groups documents by a specified field and applies aggregation functions.
- **`$sort`**: Sorts the documents by one or more fields.
- **`$limit`**: Limits the number of documents.
- **`$skip`**: Skips a specified number of documents, useful for pagination.
- **`$unwind`**: Deconstructs an array into separate documents.
- **`$lookup`**: Joins data from another collection based on a specified field.

These operators form the building blocks of MongoDB's **aggregation pipeline**, enabling you to efficiently transform and analyze your data in powerful ways. By combining these operators in various sequences, you can build complex queries that are capable of solving a wide range of data processing problems.
