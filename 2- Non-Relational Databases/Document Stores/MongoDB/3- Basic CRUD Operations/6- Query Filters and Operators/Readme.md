# 📝 **Query Filters and Operators in MongoDB**

MongoDB provides powerful query filters and operators that allow you to retrieve specific documents based on your conditions. These filters help define the criteria for which documents to include in your results. Operators can perform operations such as comparison, logical operations, and array manipulations.

### **Key Query Filters and Operators:**
1. Comparison Operators (e.g., `$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt`)
2. Logical Operators (e.g., `$and`, `$or`, `$not`)
3. Element Operators (e.g., `$exists`, `$type`)
4. Array Operators (e.g., `$in`, `$size`, `$all`)

## 🚀 **What Are Query Filters and Operators?**

In MongoDB, **query filters** define the conditions that documents must meet in order to be returned by the query. These filters are expressed using **operators** that perform various types of operations on the fields within the documents.

For example:
- To filter documents based on exact values, you can use comparison operators.
- To match multiple conditions, you can use logical operators.
- To work with arrays, MongoDB provides array-specific operators.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Comparison Operators**

Comparison operators are used to match documents based on the values of fields. These operators are placed within the query condition to specify the type of comparison to perform.

### **List of Comparison Operators**

| Operator  | Description                                     | Example                                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `$eq`      | Matches values that are equal to the specified value | `{ age: { $eq: 25 } }`  → Matches documents where age is 25 |
| `$ne`      | Matches values that are not equal to the specified value | `{ age: { $ne: 25 } }`  → Matches documents where age is not 25 |
| `$gt`      | Matches values greater than the specified value  | `{ age: { $gt: 25 } }`  → Matches documents where age is greater than 25 |
| `$gte`     | Matches values greater than or equal to the specified value | `{ age: { $gte: 25 } }` → Matches documents where age is greater than or equal to 25 |
| `$lt`      | Matches values less than the specified value    | `{ age: { $lt: 25 } }`  → Matches documents where age is less than 25 |
| `$lte`     | Matches values less than or equal to the specified value | `{ age: { $lte: 25 } }` → Matches documents where age is less than or equal to 25 |
| `$in`      | Matches values that are in the specified array   | `{ age: { $in: [25, 30, 35] } }` → Matches documents where age is 25, 30, or 35 |
| `$nin`     | Matches values that are not in the specified array | `{ age: { $nin: [25, 30, 35] } }` → Matches documents where age is not 25, 30, or 35 |

### **Example:**
```javascript
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25, $lt: 35 } })
```
This query will match users with an age greater than 25 and less than 35.

## 🧩 **Logical Operators**

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions. They allow you to create more complex queries by combining simple conditions.

### **List of Logical Operators**

| Operator  | Description                                    | Example                                                 |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `$and`     | Combines multiple conditions that must all be true | `{ $and: [ { age: { $gte: 25 } }, { status: "active" } ] }` → Matches documents where age >= 25 and status is active |
| `$or`      | Combines multiple conditions, at least one of which must be true | `{ $or: [ { age: { $gte: 25 } }, { status: "active" } ] }` → Matches documents where age >= 25 or status is active |
| `$nor`     | Combines multiple conditions, none of which can be true | `{ $nor: [ { age: { $gte: 25 } }, { status: "inactive" } ] }` → Matches documents where neither condition is true |
| `$not`     | Inverts the effect of a query condition         | `{ age: { $not: { $gt: 25 } } }` → Matches documents where age is not greater than 25 |

### **Example:**
```javascript
db.users.find({
  $or: [
    { age: { $gte: 25 } },
    { status: "active" }
  ]
})
```
This query will match users who are either 25 years old or older, or who have an "active" status.

## 🔎 **Element Operators**

Element operators are used to test the presence and type of fields in documents.

### **List of Element Operators**

| Operator  | Description                                             | Example                                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$exists` | Checks for the presence of a field                      | `{ age: { $exists: true } }` → Matches documents where the `age` field exists |
| `$type`   | Matches documents where the field is of a specific BSON type | `{ age: { $type: "int" } }` → Matches documents where the `age` field is of type integer |

### **Example:**
```javascript
db.users.find({ age: { $exists: true } })
```
This query will match documents where the `age` field exists, regardless of its value.

## 📦 **Array Operators**

Array operators are used for querying fields that contain arrays. They allow you to filter documents based on array elements and their properties.

### **List of Array Operators**

| Operator    | Description                                                | Example                                                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$in`       | Matches documents where a field contains at least one of the specified values in an array | `{ colors: { $in: ["red", "green"] } }` → Matches documents where the `colors` field contains either "red" or "green" |
| `$all`      | Matches documents where a field contains all the specified values in an array | `{ colors: { $all: ["red", "green"] } }` → Matches documents where the `colors` field contains both "red" and "green" |
| `$size`     | Matches documents where the field is an array of a specified size | `{ tags: { $size: 3 } }` → Matches documents where the `tags` array contains exactly 3 elements |
| `$elemMatch`| Matches documents where an array field contains at least one element matching all the conditions in a specified query | `{ scores: { $elemMatch: { score: { $gt: 80 }, subject: "math" } } }` → Matches documents where `scores` contains an element with score > 80 and subject "math" |

### **Example:**
```javascript
db.users.find({
  colors: { $in: ["red", "blue"] }
})
```
This query will match documents where the `colors` field contains either "red" or "blue".

## 🛠️ **Using Query Filters in MongoDB**

MongoDB allows you to use these operators and filters within the `find()`, `update()`, and other query methods. Here’s how to structure your queries with filters:

### **Find Example:**
```javascript
db.users.find({
  age: { $gt: 20, $lt: 40 },    // Age between 20 and 40
  status: "active"              // Status is "active"
})
```

### **Update Example:**
```javascript
db.users.updateMany(
  { age: { $gt: 30 } },          // Update users older than 30
  { $set: { status: "senior" } } // Set status to "senior"
)
```

### **Delete Example:**
```javascript
db.users.deleteMany({
  status: { $in: ["inactive", "suspended"] }
})
```
