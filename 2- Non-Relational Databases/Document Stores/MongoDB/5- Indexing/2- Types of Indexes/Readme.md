### **Types of Indexes in MongoDB**

MongoDB supports various types of indexes to optimize different types of queries. Each type of index serves a unique purpose, depending on the query patterns and data structure in your MongoDB application. Below are the most common types of indexes:

---

### **1. Single-field Indexes**

#### **Overview:**
A **single-field index** is the most basic type of index in MongoDB. It indexes a single field of a collection's documents.

#### **Usage:**
- It is used to optimize queries that filter or sort based on a single field.
- MongoDB automatically creates a default single-field index on the `_id` field of every collection to ensure the uniqueness of the documents.

#### **Example:**
Creating a single-field index on the `username` field:
```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ "username": 1 })  // 1 for ascending, -1 for descending
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Simple to create and manage.
- Provides efficient lookups for queries that filter or sort by a specific field.

### **2. Compound Indexes**

#### **Overview:**
A **compound index** is an index that consists of more than one field. MongoDB creates a single index entry for each unique combination of field values.

#### **Usage:**
- Compound indexes are useful when you query on multiple fields at once. If you often query using combinations of fields, compound indexes can drastically improve performance.
- The order of fields in the index is important. MongoDB uses the index based on the leftmost prefix of the fields in the compound index.

#### **Example:**
Creating a compound index on `firstName` and `lastName`:
```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ "firstName": 1, "lastName": 1 })
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Improves the performance of queries that filter on multiple fields.
- MongoDB can optimize queries using the leftmost prefix of the index.

### **3. Geospatial Indexes**

#### **Overview:**
MongoDB provides **geospatial indexes** to support location-based queries. These indexes are optimized for querying geographical data, such as points, polygons, or spheres.

#### **Usage:**
- **2dsphere index**: Supports queries for spherical geometry on a globe (latitude and longitude), including queries like near, within a polygon, or geospatial range queries.
- **2d index**: Used for legacy flat-geospatial queries on a two-dimensional plane.

#### **Example:**
Creating a **2dsphere** index for a field that stores geographical locations:
```javascript
db.locations.createIndex({ "location": "2dsphere" })
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Optimizes geospatial queries like finding points within a radius or within a polygon.
- Supports efficient location-based search and filtering.

### **4. Text Indexes**

#### **Overview:**
A **text index** allows for text search on string fields. MongoDB uses **text indexes** for performing full-text search queries, which can search for words and phrases in a text field.

#### **Usage:**
- Text indexes are useful for searching text fields, like articles or blog posts.
- MongoDB supports text search for multiple languages and allows searching on text fields using operators like `$text`, `$search`, etc.

#### **Example:**
Creating a text index on the `content` field:
```javascript
db.articles.createIndex({ "content": "text" })
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Enables powerful full-text search capabilities within your MongoDB collections.
- Supports text search with operators like `$text`, `$search`, `$language`, and `$caseSensitive`.

---

### **5. Hashed Indexes**

#### **Overview:**
A **hashed index** indexes the hash value of a field, rather than the value itself. Hashed indexes are particularly useful for sharding in MongoDB, as they ensure that data is distributed evenly across shards.

#### **Usage:**
- Hashed indexes are ideal for sharding, as they allow MongoDB to evenly distribute documents across different shards based on the hash of the indexed field.
- The hashed index can only be used for equality queries (`$eq`), not for range queries.

#### **Example:**
Creating a hashed index on the `userId` field for sharding:
```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ "userId": "hashed" })
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Ensures even distribution of data across shards in sharded clusters.
- Useful when you need efficient equality queries.

---

### **6. TTL (Time-to-Live) Indexes**

#### **Overview:**
A **TTL index** automatically removes documents from a collection after a specified time period. This is useful for time-sensitive data, such as logs or session information.

#### **Usage:**
- TTL indexes are used to delete documents after a specific amount of time has passed since a field (often a date or timestamp field).
- MongoDB automatically removes expired documents once the TTL period is reached.

#### **Example:**
Creating a TTL index on the `createdAt` field to expire documents 3600 seconds (1 hour) after the `createdAt` timestamp:
```javascript
db.sessions.createIndex({ "createdAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 })
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Automatically cleans up outdated or expired data without requiring manual intervention.
- Great for scenarios like session management, caching, or event logs where the data has a time-based lifespan.

### **Summary of Index Types:**

| **Index Type**            | **Use Case**                                   | **Example**                                         |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Single-field Index**     | Query on a single field (e.g., username)       | `{ "username": 1 }`                                 |
| **Compound Index**         | Query on multiple fields (e.g., first and last names) | `{ "firstName": 1, "lastName": 1 }`                |
| **Geospatial Index**       | Location-based queries (e.g., geolocation)     | `{ "location": "2dsphere" }`                        |
| **Text Index**             | Full-text search on string fields              | `{ "content": "text" }`                             |
| **Hashed Index**           | Sharding and equality queries                 | `{ "userId": "hashed" }`                            |
| **TTL Index**              | Automatic expiration of documents after a time | `{ "createdAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 }`  |

Each type of index in MongoDB is tailored for specific use cases and optimizes performance for different query patterns. Choosing the right index type depends on the nature of your application and the types of queries you commonly run.
