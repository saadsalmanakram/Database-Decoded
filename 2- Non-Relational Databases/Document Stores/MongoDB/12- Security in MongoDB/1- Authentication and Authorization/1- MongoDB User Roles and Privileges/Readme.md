### **MongoDB User Roles and Privileges**

In MongoDB, **user roles** and **privileges** are crucial for controlling access to the system and ensuring security within the database. MongoDB uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, which means that access to data is granted based on the roles assigned to users. These roles specify what actions a user can perform on specific databases or collections.

#### **1. MongoDB User Roles**

A **role** in MongoDB defines a set of privileges. These privileges grant users access to various database operations (like reading, writing, or administering the system). MongoDB comes with several predefined built-in roles, and you can also define custom roles tailored to your security requirements.

##### **Built-in Roles**

1. **Database User Roles**:
   - **`read`**: Grants read-only access to a database. Users with this role can query documents, but they cannot insert, update, or delete data.
   - **`readWrite`**: Grants both read and write access to a database. Users can query, insert, update, and delete documents within the database.
   - **`dbAdmin`**: Provides administrative access to the database, allowing users to manage collections, indexes, and database-level operations, but not perform actions on the data itself (e.g., no ability to read or write data).
   - **`dbOwner`**: A role that provides full control over all aspects of a database, including reading, writing, managing collections and indexes, and assigning user roles within the database.

2. **Cluster Admin Roles**:
   - **`clusterAdmin`**: Provides administrative privileges for cluster management, including managing sharded clusters, replica sets, and monitoring the health of the cluster.
   - **`clusterManager`**: Allows users to manage the cluster's configuration and monitor operations, such as adding or removing shards.
   - **`clusterMonitor`**: Allows users to monitor the cluster's performance and gather statistics without making changes.
   - **`hostManager`**: Allows users to manage the host machine configurations for the database nodes in the cluster.

3. **Superuser Role**:
   - **`root`**: A superuser role that provides full administrative control over the MongoDB instance. This role allows users to perform any action across all databases, including creating and managing users, altering databases, and viewing and modifying all data.

4. **Backup and Restore Roles**:
   - **`backup`**: Grants the ability to perform backups of the database. Users with this role can use tools like `mongodump` and `mongorestore` to back up and restore data.
   - **`restore`**: Grants the ability to restore data from backups into MongoDB.

5. **Security and User Management Roles**:
   - **`userAdmin`**: Grants users the ability to create and manage users and roles for a specific database, but they cannot perform any data management operations (insert, update, delete).
   - **`userAdminAnyDatabase`**: Provides the ability to create and manage users and roles for any database within the MongoDB instance.
   - **`root`**: In addition to managing all aspects of the MongoDB instance, this role can also create, modify, and delete users and roles across all databases.

##### **Predefined Roles in MongoDB Example**:

- **`read`**:
  - Allows read-only access to the database, with no ability to modify data.
- **`readWrite`**:
  - Allows both read and write access to the database.
- **`dbAdmin`**:
  - Grants administrative privileges for managing collections, indexes, and other database-level operations.
- **`root`**:
  - Full administrative privileges across the MongoDB instance, including the ability to manage users, databases, and configurations.

#### **2. MongoDB Privileges**

A **privilege** in MongoDB defines a specific action that can be performed on a database resource, such as a collection, database, or even a particular field in a document. MongoDB grants privileges to roles, and users are assigned roles that contain these privileges.

##### **Types of Privileges in MongoDB**:
1. **Action**: The specific operation the user can perform, such as `find`, `insert`, `update`, `remove`, or administrative tasks like `createIndex`.
   
   Examples of actions:
   - **`find`**: Allows a user to read documents from a collection.
   - **`insert`**: Allows a user to insert documents into a collection.
   - **`update`**: Allows a user to update documents in a collection.
   - **`remove`**: Allows a user to remove documents from a collection.
   - **`createIndex`**: Grants a user the ability to create indexes in a collection.
   - **`drop`**: Allows the user to delete a collection or index.
   - **`killOp`**: Allows a user to terminate a running operation.

2. **Resource**: The object the privilege applies to, such as a database, collection, or even a specific document. In MongoDB, resources are defined by:
   - **Database**: Refers to an entire database (e.g., `admin`, `test`).
   - **Collection**: Refers to a specific collection within a database (e.g., `users` or `orders`).
   - **Cluster**: Refers to administrative actions applied across the entire cluster.

3. **Actions on Resources**: Privileges are granted to roles that define actions users can perform on resources. For example, a user with a **`readWrite`** role can perform actions like `find`, `insert`, `update`, and `remove` on a given collection.

#### **Example of Role and Privileges**:
Hereâ€™s an example of how privileges are assigned in MongoDB:

```javascript
db.createRole({
  role: "readWriteOrders",
  privileges: [
    {
      resource: { db: "store", collection: "orders" },
      actions: [ "find", "insert", "update", "remove" ]
    }
  ],
  roles: []
});
```

This custom role **`readWriteOrders`** grants the user the ability to perform `find`, `insert`, `update`, and `remove` actions on the `orders` collection within the `store` database.

---

#### **3. Custom Roles**

MongoDB allows you to define **custom roles** tailored to your needs. A custom role consists of specific privileges and can be created with granular control over the actions allowed.

To create a custom role, you use the `createRole()` function, where you define:
- The **role name**.
- The **privileges** that grant actions (e.g., read, write, administrative).
- Optionally, **other roles** that the custom role inherits.

Example of creating a custom role:

```javascript
db.createRole({
  role: "writeUserData",
  privileges: [
    { resource: { db: "app", collection: "users" }, actions: [ "insert", "update" ] },
    { resource: { db: "app", collection: "logs" }, actions: [ "insert" ] }
  ],
  roles: []
});
```

This custom role allows users to **insert** and **update** data in the `users` collection and insert data into the `logs` collection in the `app` database.

---

#### **4. Role Inheritance**

Roles can inherit other roles. For example, if you have a custom role that requires administrative privileges for indexing, you can create a role that inherits from **`dbAdmin`**.

```javascript
db.createRole({
  role: "customDbAdmin",
  privileges: [],
  roles: [ { role: "dbAdmin", db: "myDb" } ]
});
```

In this case, the `customDbAdmin` role inherits all the privileges of the `dbAdmin` role in the `myDb` database.

---

### **5. Managing MongoDB Users**

MongoDB provides the following commands to manage users and roles:

1. **Create a User**:
   ```javascript
   db.createUser({
     user: "exampleUser",
     pwd: "password123",
     roles: [ "readWrite" ]
   });
   ```
   This command creates a user named `exampleUser` with `readWrite` access to a database.

2. **Grant Roles to a User**:
   ```javascript
   db.grantRolesToUser("exampleUser", [ { role: "readWrite", db: "myDb" } ]);
   ```
   This command grants the `readWrite` role to the user on the `myDb` database.

3. **Revoke Roles from a User**:
   ```javascript
   db.revokeRolesFromUser("exampleUser", [ { role: "readWrite", db: "myDb" } ]);
   ```
   This command revokes the `readWrite` role from the user on the `myDb` database.

4. **Remove a User**:
   ```javascript
   db.dropUser("exampleUser");
   ```
   This command deletes the specified user.

### **Conclusion**

In MongoDB, **user roles** and **privileges** are essential for securing access to your databases and ensuring that users only have the necessary permissions for their job responsibilities. The built-in roles provide a good starting point, and custom roles offer flexibility to fine-tune access control based on specific application requirements.

Key points:
- MongoDB supports **role-based access control (RBAC)** to grant fine-grained access to data.
- There are several **predefined roles** (e.g., `read`, `readWrite`, `dbAdmin`) for common use cases.
- Custom roles can be created to tailor access control based on specific requirements.
- Roles can inherit other roles to extend their privileges.
- MongoDB allows flexible **user management** using commands like `createUser`, `grantRolesToUser`, and

 `dropUser`.
