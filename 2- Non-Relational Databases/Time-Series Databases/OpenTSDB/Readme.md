# **OpenTSDB**: Scalable Time Series Database

---

## üåç **What is OpenTSDB?**

**OpenTSDB** (Open Time Series Database) is an open-source, distributed time series database designed to store, index, and query large volumes of time-stamped data. Built on top of **HBase**, OpenTSDB is ideal for handling **metrics**, **logs**, and **sensor data** in real-time at scale. It is widely used for **monitoring**, **analytics**, and **IoT applications** where high write throughput and efficient querying of time-series data are required.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features of OpenTSDB**

### 1. **Scalability**
   - OpenTSDB is designed for **horizontal scaling**, allowing it to handle billions of time-series data points across multiple machines. It leverages **HBase** to manage and store large datasets efficiently in a distributed environment.

### 2. **High Write Throughput**
   - OpenTSDB is optimized for handling high-frequency writes, making it ideal for applications that need to ingest vast amounts of time-series data quickly, such as system monitoring, sensor data, and performance metrics.

### 3. **Time Series Data Model**
   - OpenTSDB stores time-series data as a combination of **metric**, **timestamp**, **tags**, and **values**. It allows the user to store metadata in the form of **tags** to provide better context for the data and to enable fast filtering and querying.

### 4. **Querying with TSDQL**
   - OpenTSDB uses a query language called **TSDQL (Time Series Database Query Language)** for querying time-series data. It supports aggregation, downsampling, and filtering of time-series data, making it easy to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.

### 5. **Efficient Storage and Compression**
   - OpenTSDB leverages **HBase** for efficient storage, offering features like **columnar storage**, **compression**, and **time-based partitioning** for optimizing read and write performance.

### 6. **Tagging for Better Data Organization**
   - OpenTSDB allows you to attach **tags** to data points, providing a way to store metadata along with the time-series data. Tags enable efficient filtering and grouping of data for querying, making it easier to organize and analyze large datasets.

### 7. **Integration with Other Tools**
   - OpenTSDB integrates well with a variety of visualization and alerting tools, such as **Grafana** for visualizing time-series data, and **Prometheus** for monitoring and alerting purposes.

### 8. **REST API and Web Interface**
   - OpenTSDB provides a **RESTful API** for programmatic access to data, making it easy to interact with and integrate into custom applications. Additionally, it offers a **web-based user interface** for visualizing and querying data through simple HTTP requests.

### 9. **Downsampling and Aggregation**
   - OpenTSDB supports **downsampling** data over time to store only relevant and summarized data at a lower resolution. This reduces storage needs while preserving the ability to analyze long-term trends and patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è **OpenTSDB Architecture Overview**

### **1. Time Series Data Model**
   - **Metric**: The name of the time-series data (e.g., `cpu_load`, `temperature`).
   - **Timestamp**: The time when the data point was collected, stored as a Unix timestamp.
   - **Tags**: Key-value pairs that provide metadata for better context and enable efficient querying (e.g., `host=server01`, `region=us-west`).
   - **Value**: The actual data point, which can be numeric (e.g., `75.3` for CPU load).

### **2. HBase Backend**
   - OpenTSDB relies on **HBase**, a distributed columnar store, to manage time-series data. HBase is designed for high throughput and low-latency reads and writes, making it suitable for time-series workloads.
   - OpenTSDB uses HBase for **data storage**, **indexing**, and **replication**.

### **3. Write Path**
   - Data is written to OpenTSDB via its **REST API**, where data points are associated with a **metric**, **tags**, **timestamp**, and **value**.
   - The data is then stored in HBase and indexed by the metric name, timestamp, and tags to enable efficient querying.

### **4. Read Path**
   - When querying data, OpenTSDB retrieves data from HBase using the **TSDQL** query language. It applies filters based on **metric**, **tags**, and **time range** to retrieve relevant data points efficiently.

### **5. Downsampling and Aggregation**
   - OpenTSDB supports **downsampling** through aggregation functions like **average**, **sum**, **min**, and **max** to reduce data storage. This allows users to store and analyze historical data at different granularities (e.g., daily, hourly, or minute-based).

## üìä **Use Cases for OpenTSDB**

### 1. **System and Application Monitoring**
   - OpenTSDB is commonly used for monitoring systems and applications in real-time. It allows users to track **CPU usage**, **memory consumption**, **disk I/O**, **network activity**, and other metrics over time.

### 2. **IoT Data Collection and Analysis**
   - OpenTSDB is a popular choice for storing and analyzing data generated by **IoT devices**. It can handle high-frequency data from sensors and provide insights into temperature, humidity, pressure, and other environmental variables.

### 3. **Metrics Storage for Cloud Infrastructure**
   - OpenTSDB is well-suited for storing and querying metrics from cloud-based infrastructure, such as **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud**. It can track resource utilization, API request rates, and network traffic to monitor cloud health.

### 4. **Business Metrics and Analytics**
   - Companies use OpenTSDB to track business metrics such as **user activity**, **sales performance**, and **inventory levels**. By storing these metrics over time, businesses can perform long-term analysis to optimize operations and improve decision-making.

### 5. **Performance Monitoring in High-Throughput Systems**
   - OpenTSDB is used in systems that require **high-throughput data collection**, such as in **e-commerce platforms**, **financial services**, and **telecommunications**. It helps track performance metrics to ensure systems are running optimally.

### 6. **Real-Time Dashboards and Visualization**
   - OpenTSDB integrates with **Grafana** and other visualization tools to create **real-time dashboards**. It allows users to visualize time-series data in graphs, enabling immediate insights into system performance or business operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Getting Started with OpenTSDB**

### **1. Installing OpenTSDB**

To install OpenTSDB, follow these steps:

1. Install **HBase** (for data storage) and configure it properly. You can find HBase installation guides [here](https://hbase.apache.org/).
2. Download the latest OpenTSDB release from the [OpenTSDB GitHub releases page](https://github.com/OpenTSDB/open-tsdb/releases).
3. Start OpenTSDB with HBase:
   ```bash
   ./bin/tsdb tsd
   ```

### **2. Creating a Metric and Inserting Data**

To insert data into OpenTSDB, you can use the **HTTP API**. Here‚Äôs an example of inserting a metric for **CPU load**:

```bash
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:4242/api/put?metric=cpu_load&timestamp=1615771854000&value=65.2&tags=host=server01,region=us-east"
```

This inserts a CPU load value of **65.2** for the host `server01` at the specified timestamp.

### **3. Querying Data**

You can query data using the **TSDQL** query language. Here‚Äôs an example of a simple query:

```bash
curl -XGET "http://localhost:4242/api/query?start=1h-ago&end=now&metric=cpu_load&tags=host=server01"
```

This query fetches the `cpu_load` metric for `server01` from the last hour.

### **4. Setting Up Downsampling**

To downsample data, create a **Rollup Policy** that specifies how often data should be aggregated:

```bash
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:4242/api/rollups?metric=cpu_load&tags=host=server01&aggregation=avg&interval=1h"
```

This sets up an average aggregation for the `cpu_load` metric every hour.
