# **FaunaDB**: Globally Distributed Database with Native GraphQL Support

---

## üåê **What is FaunaDB?**

**FaunaDB** is a cloud-native, serverless, globally distributed database designed for applications that require low-latency, reliable, and scalable data storage. It offers a unique blend of capabilities from both **relational** and **NoSQL** databases while supporting **GraphQL** and its own powerful query language, **FQL (Fauna Query Language)**.

FaunaDB abstracts away the complexities of infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on building applications without managing servers, clusters, or sharding. Its **ACID-compliant transactions**, strong **consistency guarantees**, and **native support for serverless** architectures make it a robust choice for modern applications.

## üöÄ **Key Features of FaunaDB**

### 1. **Serverless Architecture**
   - Fully managed and **serverless**, eliminating the need for provisioning, scaling, or maintaining infrastructure.

### 2. **Global Distribution**
   - Data is distributed across multiple regions for **low-latency access** and high availability.

### 3. **ACID Transactions**
   - Supports **multi-region, ACID-compliant transactions** for strong consistency and reliability.

### 4. **Native GraphQL Support**
   - Built-in support for **GraphQL** APIs, enabling developers to interact with FaunaDB using GraphQL syntax.

### 5. **FQL (Fauna Query Language)**
   - A powerful, functional query language designed for complex queries and database operations.

### 6. **Strong Consistency**
   - Provides global strong consistency without compromising performance.

### 7. **Security and Access Control**
   - Fine-grained **role-based access control (RBAC)**, **authentication**, and **encryption** for data protection.

### 8. **Built-In Indexing**
   - Automatic indexing for optimized query performance and retrieval.

### 9. **Integration with Modern Stacks**
   - Works seamlessly with modern **Jamstack**, **serverless functions**, and **microservices** architectures.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Architecture Overview**

### **Core Concepts**

1. **Serverless Compute**:  
   FaunaDB abstracts away infrastructure management, providing a compute layer that dynamically scales based on workload.

2. **Global Distribution**:  
   Data is replicated across multiple regions to ensure **low-latency access** and **fault tolerance**.

3. **Document and Relational Hybrid**:  
   Supports both **document-style** data storage and **relational joins**, giving flexibility to your data model.

4. **Multi-Tenant**:  
   Designed for multi-tenant use cases, enabling shared infrastructure with strong isolation guarantees.

## üìù **Example Queries**

### **GraphQL Query**

Fetch user data using GraphQL:

```graphql
query {
  findUserByID(id: "12345") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### **FQL Query**

Add a new user using Fauna Query Language (FQL):

```fql
Create(
  Collection("users"),
  {
    data: {
      name: "Alice",
      email: "alice@example.com"
    }
  }
)
```
